        <img src="images/profile.jpeg" alt="Hello, my name is Nancy Apiyo" width="200">
        <p>Hello! I'm Ezra Taft Brigham Essien, a driven software programming student with a 
            flair for web development and a passion for writing codes and playing around with them. 
            I'm currently advancing my skills as I pursue a degree in Computer Software Engineering 
            at Brigham Young University. I'm on a constant quest to innovate and learn. I love playing 
            video games and I hope to create one some day.
            Let's connect and explore the ever-evolving world of software programming together!
            Besides my passion for programming and coding, I'm also an anime and gaming enthusiast. 
            When I'm not coding, I immerse myself in the captivating worlds of anime series and embark 
            on epic gaming adventures. Anime fuels my creativity, while gaming sharpens my problem-solving 
            skills. These hobbies provide both enjoyment and inspiration, reminding me that innovation 
            can come from unexpected places.
